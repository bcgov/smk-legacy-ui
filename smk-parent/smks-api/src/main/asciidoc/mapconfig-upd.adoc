== {PUT} MapConfiguration/{id} - Update a LMF Map Configuration (not for publishing)

Executing a PUT at the MapConfiguration endpoint with the LMF id and a body containing the required changes will udpate the Map Configuration.

NOTE: The document must include the correct "_rev" and "_id" system values. If these are missing, the update will fail. You can get the latest values by fetching the current resource from {GET} /MapConfigurations/{id} prior to updating
WARNING: It is not possible to set the "Published" flag to true via this endpoint. Attempting to do so will throw an exception.
