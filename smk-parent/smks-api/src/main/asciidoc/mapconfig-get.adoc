== {GET} MapConfiguration/{id} - Retrieve the latest versions of a SMK Map Configurations (non-published only)

Executing a GET at the MapConfiguration endpoint with the SMK id will return the related Map Configuration document

NOTE: The document returned will be the latest version, not the published version. To get the published version, you must call the /Published/ endpoints
NOTE: It is possible to fetch previous version from this endpoint by including a query parameter of 'version' with the desired version number. This is not the preferred method of getting the current published configuration.
