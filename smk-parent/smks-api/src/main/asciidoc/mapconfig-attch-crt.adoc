== {POST} MapConfiguration/{config_id}/Attachments/ - Create a new Attachment for a Map Configuration

Executing a POST at the MapConfiguration/{config_id}/Attachments endpoint with a formdata multipart file containing the desired attachment binary will create a new attachment document for this configuration.

Additional request parameters are: 

Attachment ID {id='my-attachment'}
Attachment Type {type='kml|kmz|shape|vector|image'}

If the type is excluded, the SMK service will attempt to determine the attachment type. If the attachment type is:

application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml - SMK will attempt to convert KML to geojson
application/vnd.google-earth.kmz - SMK will attempt to unzip the KMZ, and convert contained KML to geojson
application/zip - SMK will attempt to unzip the zip file, and convert contained shapefile to geojson

All other types will be stored directly as standard attachments with no conversion.

If you are uploading an attachment to use as a custom marker image, you must ensure your markerUrl in the layer configuration contains the matching attachment ID.

NOTE: Supplying KML, KMZ, or Shapefile attachments will trigger an automatic conversion of the suppllied attachment to GeoJSON. The source attachment will not be preserved.
