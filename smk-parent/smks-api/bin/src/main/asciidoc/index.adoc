  [[overview-http-status-codes]]
  == HTTP status codes
  Person-service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
  use of HTTP status codes.

  |===
  | Status code | Usage

  | `200 OK`
  | Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
  | The actual response will depend on the request method used.
  | In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
  | In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

  | `201 Created`
  | The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

  | `204 No Content`
  | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

  | `400 Bad Request`
  | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

  | `404 Not Found`
  | The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
