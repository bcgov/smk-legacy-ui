== {GET} LayerLibrary - Retrieve All MPCM ArcGIS Catalog Listings

Executing a GET at the LayerConfig endpoint will query the MPCM ArcGIS Layer Catalog service and create a listing of all available layers that can be used by LMF. The resulting snippets are incomplete and meant for listing only.

CAUTION: The MPCM Layer Catalog contains public and private records. If you lack access to a private layer, it may display in this list but any further queries will fail.
